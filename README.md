# Msc-Project
MSc Advanced Computer Science (Data Analytics)
University of Leeds


The SQL file is the code used to find the required data in the MIMIC-IV database for subsequent operations.

The two CSV format files are processed data for experimental modelling.

The three ipynb files are the main operational code for the project.

1） Data processing.ipynb
This code is used to pre-process the data and consists of two parts.
1) merging the data
2) Cleaning the data

2） Modelling
This code is used to model the mortality predictions and consists of 5 parts.
1) Accuracy calculations for Oasis itself
2) Logistic regression modelling and accuracy calculation
3) Decision tree modelling and accuracy calculation
4) Random Forest modelling and accuracy calculation
5) Neural network modelling and group accuracy calculation


3） Model interpretation
This section explains the neural network model using four different interpretable algorithms.
1) Shapley
2) LIME
3) Partial Dependence Plot
4) Morris Sensitivity Analysis
